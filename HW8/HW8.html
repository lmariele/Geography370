<h1>Homework 8: Tennessee Ratio Choropleths</h1>

<p>These maps show the different employment styles that people working in the agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting, and mining industries operate under. This industry is not that large to begin with so you will see many percentages that are very small. I wanted to focus on this industry, however, because it relates to Ducktown, TN and that has been a particular interest of mine. The industry has seen a decrease in the past 100 years.</p>

<h2>Map 1</h2>

    <p> This map shows the number of people who work privately in the said industries above. For this map I used Quanitle divisions because it makes the sections equal and orders them from smallest to largest. However, you can see there is a division that is simply the number two and doesn't include anything else. This is because the numbers that are used for this map are extremely small and I think if I were to do it again I would do natural breaks so that the data could better represent itself.</p>

<h2>Map 2</h2>

    </a>
    <p> This map shows the number of people who work in non-profit private companies in the said industries above. For this map I used Natural Breaks because there are nearly zero people who work in the non-profit private sector of agriculture and others so I wanted the data to allow itself the best chance to represent itself. However, Natural Breaks can be misleading because it is completely up to QGIS to determine that.</p>

<h2>Map 3</h2>
<a href="./Self-Employed_Total_TN.png">
    <img src="./Self-Employed_Total_TN.png" alt="My Map" width="700px">
    </a>
    <p> This map shows the number of self-employed individuals who work in the said industries above. For this map I used Equal Interval because I thought it would show how many people there are for that are self-employed. It is more dense in areas close to urban centers like Memphis and Nashville, TN.</p>
